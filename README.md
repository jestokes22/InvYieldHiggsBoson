# InvYieldHiggsBoson

this project is an effort to use the CMS data from 2012 to calculate the Invariant Yield of a Higgs Boson from a Higgs to tau tau lepton decay. In this case, the invariant yield is equal to the invariant mass, which is calculated through the values of the energies and the momenta of the decay products (in the case of a higgs to tau tau decay, the energies and momenta of the two tau leptons would be used to calculate the invariant mass of the higgs boson.).
